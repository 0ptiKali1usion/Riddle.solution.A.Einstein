Java based solution to Albert Einsteins's 15 hint/clue/step house riddle.

"This is NOTHING more, than my alpha level version of what it says it is. Read the comments if you wanna know more. Focused ONLY using it as a logic exercise, followed up with a beta level version that will have methods/functions/procedural style code.
